Game "Alhpabet", uses python3, tkinter.

## Description of this game:

In order to play the Alphabet, the game (monitor or projector screen) must be placed at eye level, so that you can see all the letters well and not tilt your head at the same time.

Choose the Alphabet speed that is most convenient for you. Start with 2 seconds. Your task is to pronounce the upper letter and react to the lower letter by raising your hand (P — Right, L — Left, B or O — Both hands together). There is no need to raise your arms very high – raise them as much as you feel comfortable, but so that the arm participates no less than from the elbow. It is necessary to pronounce the letters out loud. Avoid unnecessary tension — try to stay relaxed and strain only those muscles that are needed for movement.

## How to run it:

```python3 alphabet.py```
